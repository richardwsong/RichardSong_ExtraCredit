Code for Math 2420 Extra Credit: Chapter 3 Project G

EulerMethod.py was used to generate the four plots in part c of the project, which depict Euler's Method being used to approximate the values of p with step sizes of h = 0.18, 0.23, 0.25, and 0.3 and 40 iterations. 

RungeKutta.py was used to generate the three plots in part d of th project, which depict Range-Kutta's Method being used to approximate the values of p with step sizes of h = 0.3, 0.325, 0.35 and 60 iterations.
